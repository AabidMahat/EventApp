It occupies a prime location in the middle of town. From ancient times forward, worshippers have brought their offerings to the temple and laid them at the base of a gigantic iron trident that stands as a symbol of the heavenly mother. The temple grounds also have modest temples dedicated to the gods Ganeshji, Sakshi Gopal, and Markandeya Rishi. A unique aarti, known as Akhand Jyoti and Akhand Abhishek, are performed each morning and night. Uttarkashi is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas and is referred to as \"Saumya Varanasi\" in the Skanda Puran. The Shakti Temple is located just across from the Vishwanath Temple. It features a large \"Trishul\" that is roughly 6 metres tall and 90 centimetres in diameter at its base. There are varying theories concerning its composition, but the top half seems to be iron while the bottom half is copper. This Shakti was so named because, according to the epics, Goddess Durga (Shakti) threw it towards the demons. Over here, at this spot, stands this Shakti that was constructed after that. Conditions in Uttarkashi - Summers may be rather warm (between 30 and 35 degrees Celsius), but the cool evenings make up for it.\\n\\n\\n\\nDAY 4 (JUNE 12 & JUNE 18) : UTTARKASHI TO GANGOTRI TO UTTARKASHI HT : 3048 MTS.

    "description": "The Anthargange trek is one of the most sought after trek around Bangalore. It's the combination of trekking and cave exploration that drives the excitement factor. Anthargange hill is completely surrounded by boulders. Located around 65km from Bangalore near Kolar, this hill is at an altitude of1712m above sea level. Anthargange night trip is perfect for trekking and night cave exploration. Around 3km trek is pretty moderate as the journey beings by making your way through broken rocks and tricky path in the boulders to finally reaching the cave site to probe. This amazing experience of making your way through the formation and crawling at times because of the cave's volcanic rock formation is a tale worth sharing. The experience at Anthargange cave takes you back to the primeval times. And you finally get to be a \"Cave Man\". The effort pays off as the feeling of contentment starts settling in post the completion of the trek. Unwind by the bonfire and watch the night's magic captivate you, if luck favours, you might catch a glimpse of some wild animals around.

The everest of the Sahyadris, Kalsubai trek is a dream of every avid trekker to climb it at least once. Kalsubai is a part of the Kalsubai Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary which spreads from Kalasubai to Harischandragad in Akole. The Kalsubai sanctuary is a challenge to trekkers with its rugged hilly terrain and the Kalsubai pinnacle at its height of 5500 ft is a real steep climb.\\nhttps://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/4/a/c/event_140026252.jpeg\\nhttps://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/5/4/event_140025652.jpeg\\nAccording to the legend, Kalsu, a came to the Indore village at the foothills of Kalsubai. She took service with a Koli family on condition that she should not be asked to clean pots and sweep. Matters went smoothly till one day, when one of the family-members ordered Kalsu to clean some pots and clear away some litter. She did as she was told to, but immediately climbed the hill and stayed there till her death.\\nhttps://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/3/0/8/event_140025832.jpeg\\nThere is a steep and difficult route from Indore but trekkers prefer the ladder-route from Bari village which is about ten kms from Bhandardara. It usually takes three hours to reach the top from Bari. Soon after leaving Bari, there is a Hanuman temple and the route from behind this temple takes the hiker straight to the summit. There are three iron ladders along this route. There is a well near the last iron ladder as one approaches the top but the water is not potable. At the summit is a small temple of Kalsubai, which can seat just three people.\\nAt a height of 5500 feet Kalsubai offers a panoramic view. Towards west ,Alangad, Madangad & Kulanggad could be seen towards south is the famous Bhandardhara lake and Ratangad beyond it.\\nhttps://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/e/0/event_140025792.jpeg\\nPics Courtesy: Ruben Fredrick\\nTentative Itinerary:\\nDay 1:\\nFri 13:15 pm : Board train to Kalyan\\nDay 2 :\\nSat 06 AM : Reach Kalyan\\nSat 07 AM : Head to base village ( Breakfast on our way )\\nSat 10 AM : Reach Base Village ( lunch at base village)\\nSat 6 PM : Reach peak\\nDay 3 :\\nSun 5 AM: Wake up call and beautiful hike till sunrise.\\nSun 7 AM: Trek back to base\\nSun 11 AM : Start for Kalyan\\nSun 3 PM: Board Konark express (11019) to Hyderabad\\nDay 4: Mon 4:00 AM : Reach Hyderabad and back to work!\\nIT IS NOT A LUXURY EVENT.

    "description": "Skandagiri Sunrise Trek with Water ActivitiesSkandagiri, also historically known as Kalwarbetta or Kalavara Durga is a mountain fortress located around 70 km from Bangalore. This tiring yet rewarding trek takes you through a spectacular journey amidst the wilderness. Starting by 10 pm from Bangalore, reach the base point by midnight and hereby begin the night trek. The serene and sublime atmosphere around Skandagiri will definitely boost your adrenaline. This 8km trek can easily be completed within 4 to 5 hours of ascending and descending Tried and tested both by amateurs and professionals, this trek is a must for thrill seekers. The climb gets tedious as you reach the Papagni Temple, hereby offering treacherous terrains amongst the dense shrubs around. Thereafter the steep slopes may require tricky footwork till the summit. The ruined remains of Tipu Sultan's fort and an abandoned fort remain at the top of the hill. Skandagiri is famous for walking above the clouds, literally! As you reach the top, enjoy the bonfire on the starry night couched inside your sleeping bags. Wake up to experience the morning winds caressing you, as you open your eyes to get the most magnanimous sight of the sun rising above a bed of clouds, a sight so rare. The misty valley of Skandagiri is bound to leave an everlasting impression in your mind.Trek Difficulty: ModerateBest season: Nov to FebDistance from Bangalore: 70 kmTrek Distance: 8 kmTentative ItineraryDay 011:00 PM Pick-up starts from BangaloreDay 103:00 AM Reach Base (05kms trek one side)06:00 AM Reach peak and relax.06:15 AM Enjoy sunrise08:30 AM Descend to the base and head towards any nearby Restaurant10:30 AM Start water activities like Kayaking and Swimming11:45 AM Leave for Bangalore12:00 PM Reach BangaloreWhat's IncludedTransportation (from/to Bangalore)Sunrise TrekBreakfastGuideForest ChargesWater Activities like Kayaking and SwimmingWhat's ExcludedWater BottleSnacksAnything not mentioned in Inclusions.Things To CarryBackpackRaincoat/PonchoWater bottlesEnergy foodPersonal medicationSweater/ jackets for the nightExtra clothing (in case you plan to dive in the lake)Sports shoes or trekking shoes in good conditionFlashlight/Torch with extra batteriesTrack pants and cotton TshirtCamera (optional)NoteYour equipment & types of equipment distributed to be carried by self, like bags, sticks, etc.As you are exploring nature, don’t expect washrooms near hills.
